🔎 Title: IOT Based Smart Window with Remote Controlling System

📜 Description: Now it is era of technology where human is being dependent on machine. A window is a part of
human accommodation which is sometimes becomes a way of harm for human. Window mainly
used for air ventilation but it is also related to security. Through the window dust and intruder can
come inside the room. As human can’t stay at home all the time, they need go outside of the room
for many reasons the become a cause of tension for them. Sometimes we go out from our home for
a long time of period and we forget to close the window.  
  
Keeping these circumstances in mind, we started to think about the possible solutions for the
window. We wanted to build a smart window which will be responsive to the environmental
situations and also be responsive if any intruder or object tries to enter through the window. We also
wanted to provide the live status of the window to the owner and provide manual control to the user
to open/close the window from any distant location of the world remotely.  
  
Before starting our project, we searched over the internet about what kind of smart window projects
are already being used. We found that most of the smart window project was built with simple 1
or 2 sensors. Which means those smart windows will be only used for simple 1 or 2 purpose. Those
projects are available in various combination of sensors and various names. But no one project is
perfectly match the human needs.

As those types of projects are not fulfilling the needs of human for their window, we started develop
a system that could fulfill human desires of smart window system. We have used the most important
sensors for the automated window and also have live status monitor and user control system for the
window.
